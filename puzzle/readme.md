The `main.go` file contains a series of functions that simulate a game on a dashboard represented by a 2D grid of runes. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. **findDog**: This function scans the dashboard grid to locate the position of 'D' (representing a dog) and returns the coordinates as a slice of integers.

2. **checkDashboard**: It checks if the dashboard is a square matrix. It returns the length of the matrix if it's square, otherwise returns 0.

3. **bestTrajectory**: Given a slice of integers representing completed trajectories, it finds and prints the trajectory with the minimum steps.

4. **play**: This is the main function that simulates the game. It initializes several variables including a slice for tracking cell visits, a pointer for rewards, and a slice for storing completed trajectories. The function:
   - Ensures the dashboard is square.
   - Finds the initial position of the dog.
   - Iterates through the game for a given number of attempts, moving the dog to new positions based on certain conditions, checking for rewards, and tracking the trajectory.
   - If all rewards are collected, the trajectory is considered successful and stored.
   - If an error occurs or the game ends, it resets the necessary variables and starts a new trajectory.
   - After all attempts, it prints all successful trajectories and determines the best one.

5. **init**: Sets up a command-line flag to specify the number of attempts for the game.

6. **main**: Parses the command-line flags, initializes the dashboard, and starts the game by calling the `play` function.

This code effectively simulates a game where a dog moves on a grid, collects rewards, and tries to complete the best trajectory within a given number of attempts.
