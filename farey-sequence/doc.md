# Farey Sequence Documentation

## Introduction
The Farey sequence of order `n` is a fascinating mathematical concept that involves fractions. It consists of all fractions whose denominators are between 1 and `n`. These fractions are reduced to their simplest form and sorted in ascending order.

## Definition
Given a positive integer `n`, the Farey sequence of order `n` is the set of all fractions with a denominator between 1 and `n`, inclusive, reduced to lowest terms and arranged in increasing order of magnitude.

## Examples
- `farey(1)` returns `["0/1", "1/1"]`
- `farey(4)` returns `["0/1", "1/4", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3", "3/4", "1/1"]`
- `farey(5)` returns `["0/1", "1/5", "1/4", "1/3", "2/5", "1/2", "3/5", "2/3", "3/4", "4/5", "1/1"]`

## Usage
To use this function, simply call it with the desired order `n` and it will return the Farey sequence as a list of strings, each representing a fraction in the form "numerator/denominator".
